# Firebase Assignment - Train Scheduler


# Summary
A train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

# Theme/Look
The theme for this application is fairly minimal. Bootstrap was used to create a simple, yet attractive header and table system for the train information, as well as simple input fields and button.


# Extras
An extra header on the table shows the user's original train time they enter with the train information. After all the calculations are done in the background, the original time gets replaced with the next time (based on the frequency of the trains). I wanted to add the original time so that the user can see all their info directly onto the table.
